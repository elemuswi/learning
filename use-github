# How to use GitHub locally

First, the reason we are using GitHub is because it makes it so much easier to work in teams! It minimizes the chance that any one change breaks the project. It also allows you to see what other people
have been working on. There's a bit of a learning curve but you really only need to learn a few commands to be successful.

### Install `git`

* [Mac](https://desktop.github.com/)
* [Windows](https://desktop.github.com/)
* Linux
  * `$ sudo dnf install git-all`
  * Didn't work? Try `$ sudo apt-get install git-all`

### Terminology

* `Repository`
